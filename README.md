# LODPlanet

## The usual vite/vanilla js/three setup, use npm run dev to launch dev mode server.

## Todo:

- [x] Fix issue with faces not lining up
- [ ] Implement dynamic lod scaling values based on planet radius
- [ ] Implement noise generation for dynamic terrain and textures (textures only at further distances)
